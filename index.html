        <p>Bangladesh is experiencing one of the worst floods in its history. Over a hundred thousand people over the 15 sub-districts in Sylhet are badly impacted. Flood situation is getting even worse. This happened due to swelling of major rivers caused by continuous rain and rush of waters from the rivers. its time for us to step forward for them.
